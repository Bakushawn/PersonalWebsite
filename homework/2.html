		<h1>Current Events in Neuroscience</h1>

		<p>Although it was one of the first concepts introduced, the idea and controversy of free will is something that caught and maintained my interest through the entirety of this course.  Branching off this comes the concept of AI or “Artificial Intelligence”, which is the concept of a computer or robot being able to perform tasks as a human does due to them having human intelligence and perception of situations.  </p>
		<p>As knowledge of technology and breakthroughs in technological advancements increases, the idea of Artificial Intelligence grows every passing day.  People are constantly finding ways of creating new things that can perform tasks just as a human would while trying to eliminate the possibility of human error.  This could be from creating a robot capable of human emotions and empathy to something as mundane as the latest car model that is able to brake on its own when it senses danger.  Artificial Intelligence takes many forms and as time goes on, more research is conducted in understanding the progression of this innovative concept. </p>
		<p>Artificial intelligence is also a very controversial topic.  After all, the idea of making a robot able to perform as a human may be a bit unsettling to many people.  The controversy behind this also ties into the concept of “Free Will” that was discussed in lecture. It was often said that Free Will is a key trait that makes a human identifiable as a human.  The definition of free will is the notion that one is free to choose his/her own actions regardless of any external factors.  In other words, free will is simply the ability for humans to make decisions regardless of environmental influences.  </p>
		<p>Because of the technological advancements made in the past few years, I have found many articles regarding information on Artificial Intelligence.  One news article that really stuck out was one that I found on bbc.com titled “Go master quits because AI ‘cannot be defeated’”.  For a bit of background information, a while back I had watched a documentary on Netflix about the development of an Artificial Intelligence program called “AlphaGo” made to master the Chinese board game called “Go”.  This program was supposed to be adaptive, meaning that it would learn and develop based on its wins and losses through playing the actual board game.  </p>
		<p>The “ultimate test” to see how advanced this program really is was to put it up against the world’s greatest Go player, Lee Se-dol, who had only ended up winning one out of the three matches against the Artificial Intelligence program. </p>
		<p>This article by BBC news talks about how Lee Se-dol’s defeat against Artificial Intelligence program AlphaGo has caused him to retire from competition.  In other words, the research conducted in the development of AlphaGo as well as the realization that Artificial Intelligence programs are much more advanced than he thought is what caused him to retire.  The research conducted regarding AlphaGo was extensive and, rather than measuring activity of the human subject, it measured the activity and adaptability of the software program. This article goes into how it is difficult for an Artificial Intelligence program to determine whether it is winning or not because many of the top players rely on instinct to determine this for themselves (BBC).  This shows how the research conducted on the program had to be complicated and extensive in order for it to perform at a level even higher than the top-rated players. </p>
		<p>In relation to this, another article was found that went into depth in terms of the actual research that went into the development of AlphaGo itself. This article titled “Anthropomorphizing AlphaGO: a content analysis of the framing of Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo in the Chinese and American press” by Nathaniel Ming Curran, Jingyi Sun, and Joo-Wha Hong, talks about the background of AI, the controversy behind AI versus humans, and the interactions between AI and humans in the development of AlphaGo.  During the development of AlphaGo, the developers of this software had to put the program up against human competitors for it to learn and adapt based on wins and losses.  This expanded its knowledge in a way similar to humans practicing in competitions.  The developers measured, analyzed, and observed AlphaGo’s responses and growth during its performance against players over time to see how it “grew” in the sense that it became much more capable of winning and competing than it was before. </p>
		<p>In terms of the development and advancement of Artificial Intelligence, I believe that it is a wonderful and revolutionary breakthrough that should continue to be researched and developed.  I chose this topic because of my interest in the documentary I watched regarding AlphaGo, which really opened my eyes in terms of just how capable Artificial Intelligence actually is.  Of course, there is always a downside to the development of more thigs like this such as making humans feel more inferior, however I believe that if AI is developed in the right way, we can learn so much more about the world and we as humans can be able to do so many more things.  I think that breakthroughs like this AlphaGo software are amazing because it shows us how computers aren’t just capable of processing things at a fast rate, but are able to do so much more like think similarly to a human and use probability as a parallel to human intuition.  </p>
