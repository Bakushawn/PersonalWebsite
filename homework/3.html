		<p> The font that I am using was obtained via going to googlefonts. Specifically it is the Leckerli One font</p>
		<p> To add an interesting font like this, Simply put in a link tag with a href to the provided URL of the font. make sure the tag is in the head tag!</p>
		<p> This can also be accomplished in css using the @import tag</p>
		<p> google is a nice mistress. She provides said code for you so all you have to do is put it in the right spot :)</p>
